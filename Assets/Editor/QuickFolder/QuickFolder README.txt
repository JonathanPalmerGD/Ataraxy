Quickfolder Readme
by Jon Palmer for Darkwind Media

1. Quickfolder allows you to select multiple objects and create a new empty parent game object folder for them.

2. It binds the controls into the GameObject menu with Control/Command+Shift+Y as the hotkey to quickfolder something.

3. Quickfolder only needs to be in an Editor Folder. Feel free to move it around as necessary.

4. You can change the hotkey by adjusting line 14's menu item.

5. You can also disable the debug logs if you desire by commenting out the Debug.Log/Debug.LogError lines at the end of the script.
